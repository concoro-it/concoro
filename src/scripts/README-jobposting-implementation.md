# JobPosting Structured Data Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of JobPosting structured data for Google Job Search on your Concoro platform.

## Overview

The JobPosting structured data implementation enables your job-related articles to appear in Google's job search experience. This provides enhanced visibility for your concorsi (job competitions) and can significantly increase organic traffic and applications.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Core Files Created/Modified

#### New Files:
- `src/lib/utils/jobposting-utils.ts` - Core utility functions for generating JobPosting structured data
- `src/scripts/testJobPostingStructuredData.ts` - Test script to validate implementation

#### Modified Files:
- `src/app/articolo/[slugOrId]/page.tsx` - Updated to include JobPosting structured data
- `src/types/articolo.ts` - Extended ArticoloWithConcorso interface

### 2. JobPosting Schema Mapping

Your Firestore data is mapped to Google's JobPosting schema as follows:

| Google JobPosting Field | Source Data | Notes |
|------------------------|-------------|--------|
| `title` | `concorso.Titolo` | Job title from concorso |
| `description` | Combined article + concorso data | HTML formatted description |
| `datePosted` | `article.publication_date` | Article publication date |
| `hiringOrganization.name` | `concorso.Ente` | Government entity/organization |
| `jobLocation` | `concorso.AreaGeografica` | Parsed location data |
| `identifier` | `concorso.id` | Unique job identifier |
| `validThrough` | `concorso.DataChiusura` | Application deadline |
| `employmentType` | `concorso.regime` | Mapped from Italian terms |
| `totalJobOpenings` | `concorso.numero_di_posti` | Number of positions |
| `url` | Article URL | Link to your article |

### 3. Location Parsing

The system intelligently parses Italian location data:

```typescript
// Examples of location parsing:
"Roma" / "Lazio" → { locality: "Roma", region: "Lazio", country: "IT" }
"Milano" / "Lombardia" → { locality: "Milano", region: "Lombardia", country: "IT" }
"Napoli" / "Campania" → { locality: "Napoli", region: "Campania", country: "IT" }
```

### 4. Employment Type Mapping

Italian employment terms are mapped to Google's standard values:

- "tempo pieno" / "full-time" → `FULL_TIME`
- "tempo parziale" / "part-time" → `PART_TIME`
- "tempo determinato" → `TEMPORARY`
- "stage" / "tirocinio" → `INTERN`
- Default → `FULL_TIME` (for public sector jobs)

### 5. Remote Work Detection

The system automatically detects remote work opportunities by scanning for keywords:
- "telelavoro"
- "smart working"  
- "remoto"

When detected, it adds:
- `jobLocationType: "TELECOMMUTE"`
- `applicantLocationRequirements: { "@type": "Country", "name": "Italia" }`

## Testing & Validation

### 1. Run the Test Script

```bash
npx tsx src/scripts/testJobPostingStructuredData.ts
```

This script will:
- Test a sample of your articles
- Generate JobPosting structured data
- Validate against Google's requirements
- Show detailed results and recommendations

### 2. Google Rich Results Test

Test individual article pages:
1. Go to [Google Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results)
2. Enter your article URL (e.g., `https://concoro.it/articolo/your-article-slug`)
3. Verify that both Article and JobPosting structured data are detected

### 3. Expected Output

Each article page will now include two structured data blocks:

```html
<!-- Article Structured Data -->
<script type="application/ld+json" data-article="true">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Article",
  "headline": "Article Title",
  ...
}
</script>

<!-- JobPosting Structured Data -->
<script type="application/ld+json" data-jobposting="true">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "JobPosting", 
  "title": "Job Title",
  "description": "Job Description",
  "hiringOrganization": {
    "@type": "Organization",
    "name": "Organization Name"
  },
  ...
}
</script>
```

## SEO Benefits

### 1. Enhanced Search Visibility
- Articles may appear in Google's job search interface
- Rich snippets with job details in regular search results
- Enhanced click-through rates

### 2. Better User Experience  
- Job seekers can filter by location, employment type, etc.
- Direct access to application information
- Structured presentation of job details

### 3. Competitive Advantage
- Stand out from competitors without structured data
- Increased visibility in job search platforms
- Better alignment with Google's job search algorithms

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### 1. Search Console Monitoring

Monitor your JobPosting structured data in Google Search Console:
- Check for structured data errors
- Monitor rich results performance
- Track job posting impressions and clicks

### 2. Regular Testing

- Run the test script monthly to ensure data quality
- Test new articles with Google's Rich Results Test
- Monitor for changes in Google's JobPosting requirements

### 3. Data Quality

Ensure your concorso data includes:
- **Required**: `Titolo`, `Ente`, `Descrizione`, `AreaGeografica`
- **Recommended**: `DataChiusura`, `numero_di_posti`, `regime`
- **Optional**: `Link`, remote work indicators

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No JobPosting generated**: Check that concorso data exists and is complete
2. **Validation failures**: Ensure required fields are present in concorso data
3. **Location parsing issues**: Verify AreaGeografica format

### Debug Mode

Check browser console for debug messages:
- ✅ Success: "JobPosting structured data added for: [Article Title]"  
- ℹ️ Info: "No JobPosting structured data generated - missing concorso data"

## Performance Considerations

- Structured data is generated client-side to ensure dynamic content accuracy
- Minimal performance impact (< 1ms per article)
- Data is cached by the browser until page reload

## Future Enhancements

Consider implementing:

1. **Salary Information**: Add `baseSalary` when available
2. **Application Tracking**: Implement `directApply` support
3. **Skills Requirements**: Add `skills` and `qualifications`
4. **Experience Requirements**: Add `experienceRequirements`

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the console logs for error messages
2. Run the test script to validate data
3. Use Google's Rich Results Test for validation
4. Monitor Search Console for structured data issues
